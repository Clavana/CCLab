                <p>Prisma belongs to the Numeral Realm, a dimension where numbers and laws embody physical forms.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>The modification of the Ulam Spiral is the closest tangible representation of Prisma that can be
                    visualized in
                    our realm. Each node of the spiral represents an integer. Just like the universe, the creature’s
                    body
                    continuously expands.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Key Characteristics:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The prime numbers are the seeds of Prisma: when one of them is clicked, the creation of a new
                        creature begins.</li>
                </ul>

                <span class="yellow">What we know so far about PRISMA?</span>
                It has a critical role in creating and maintaining the balance in the universe. Through mathematical
                laws and the positioning of the prime numbers, Prisma ensures the underlying
                structures of reality remain intact. Prisma’s spiral form is no accident: it mirrors the unseen
                structures that
                allow for and are resembled in the creation of galaxies and the emergence and evolution of living
                creatures.
                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> Prisma reacts to user
                interactions, changing the direction of its development based on the
                user's thoughts (mouseIsDragged). Moreover, clicking on a prime segment initiates the creation of a new
                creature.
