    <h3> Scientific Name of the Creature: </h3>
    <p> Prisma</p>

    <h3> Discovered by: </h3>
    <p> itself</p>

    <h3> at: </h3>
    <p> the beginning </p>

    <h3> Family: </h3>
    <p> Prismatidae </p>

    <h3> Habitat: </h3>
    <p> Prisma belongs to the Numeral Realm, a dimension where numbers and laws embody physical forms. </p>

    <h3> Appearance: </h3>
    <p> The modification of the Ulam Spiral is the closest tangible representation of Prisma that can be visualized in
        our realm. Each node of the spiral represents an integer. Just like the universe, the creature’s body
        continuously expands. </p>

    <h3> Key Characteristics: </h3>
    <p> When the creature reaches a prime number, the corresponding segment, that segment begins emitting glowing
        particles to emphasize the importance of the number. </p>

    <h3> What do we know so far about the creature? </h3>
    <p> It has a critical role in creating and maintaining the balance in the
        universe. Through mathematical laws and the positioning of the prime numbers, Prisma ensures the underlying
        structures of reality remain intact. Prisma’s spiral form is no accident: it mirrors the unseen structures that
        allow for and are resembled in the creation of galaxies and the emergence and evolution of living creatures.
    </p>

    <h3> How do we interact with this creature? </h3>
    <p> Prisma reacts to user interactions, speeding up when it becomes aware of the
        user's presence (mouseIsPressed). Moreover, clicking on a prime segment initiates emitting glowing particles,
        just
        like when that prime was discovered by Prisma. </p>
